## Description
Creating README's made simple. If youre someone like me and struggle to make readme's this is the project for you. I created this to make formatting and creating a readme file very simple. As long as you have node on your computer you are all set to go. In the future I would like to make it a little more user friendly with some of the options and selections. I am proud of how it turned out for now. Will most definetly be using this in the future for creating README's.
